<!-- ## About Me

Hi there! I'm **Jenny Shyu**, a Master’s student in Business Analytics at UC San Diego's Rady School of Management with a background in Math-Econ.

### Why Business Analytics?

I’m passionate about leveraging quantitative methods, data, and technology to generate meaningful insights and tackle real-world business problems.

### What have I been working on?

Most recently, I interned at **LPL Financial**, where I worked with financial data and dashboards. I also served as the **VP of Data Analytics** in a student consulting organization and currently work as a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** for a Business Project Management course—helping students apply frameworks like prioritization matrices in real-world project planning.

In the past, I also trained and competed as a figure skater representing Chinese Taipei. -->

<!-- ### Outside of Work...

When I'm not working with data, I love:

- Skating (still!),

- Exploring new places,

- Managing my foodie Instagram,

- Traveling -->
