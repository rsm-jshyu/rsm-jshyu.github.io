    "text": "Hi there! I’m Jenny Shyu, a Master’s student in Business Analytics at UC San Diego’s Rady School of Management with a background in Math-Econ.\n\n\nI’m passionate about leveraging quantitative methods, data, and technology to generate meaningful insights and tackle real-world business problems.\n\n\n\nMost recently, I interned at LPL Financial, where I worked with financial data and dashboards. I also served as the VP of Data Analytics in a student consulting organization and currently work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for a Business Project Management course—helping students apply frameworks like prioritization matrices in real-world project planning.\nIn the past, I also trained and competed as a figure skater representing Chinese Taipei."
